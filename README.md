# TU Delft: Chess of Technical Difficulties
## About our game
  Chess of Technical Difficulties is the result of many days of hard work by two students. We have done our best to create a modern visually satisfying website
  with a bug-free, intuitive and smooth gameplay. Our game is basically chess with a "Sabotage" feature that can be used twice by each player which forces
  them to switch sides.
### Features
   - Visually satisfying, state-of-the-art interface
   - Support for touch interfaces like mobile phones and tablets
   - Dynamic website that caters itself towards different devices and resolutions
   - Powered by the featureful [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) library
   - Diligently tested to cover edge-cases
   - A special "Sabotage" feature with the potential to create very interesting, unique games
   - A chatbox to allow players to chat with each other, also used by the server to relay messages in some cases
## About the developers
  - Max Guichard, with the help of his prior front-end experience, has covered the styling of website, board/piece creation, animations, chatbox and the design of our API. His work has made extending our game with new features an easy and comfortable undertaking.
  - I have implemented the chess.js library, worked on move validations, tile highlighting, piece promotions, the move table and the game timer. I have also helped my friend with UI at times.
